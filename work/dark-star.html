          Dark Star is a UI Challenge proposed by Henry Turner, for the WeCanFixItinUI discord. The challenge is to create a fictional UI, for a sci-fi horror game set aboard "The Somerville Expedition," a research vessel facing an alien threat in deep space. As the protagonist, navigate through a hostile derelict, shooting, burning, and electrocuting your way to escape while unraveling the mystery. <br><br>
          The task consists of 3 separate screens, these can be considered "objectives" and you are free to do engage with any number of them at any level of fidelity you choose: <br><br>
          Inventory: A redesign of the inventory screen, portraying limited space and various item types, including mission-critical items, consumables, and weaponry. Each item carries a distinct description, and weapons feature customizable statistics and unlockable traits.
          <br><br>
          HUD (Heads-Up Display): A reimagination of the HUD, offering vital information for a first-person shooter experience—health, ammo, weapon type, stamina, ability cooldowns—seamlessly integrating with the eerie sci-fi horror ambiance.
          <br><br>
          Mission Log: An overhaul of the mission log, presenting different mission types, each with a description, location, and prerequisites for progression. A crucial aspect is visually distinguishing between current tasks, ensuring clarity in mission tracking.
