        I've played League of Legends for a while now. When i started playing, i looked for guides for the champion i was playing and i discovered tons of combos possibilities, but from non-official sources.<br> And now, 10 years later, there is a tutorial for new players, with a lot of explanation, and you can even switch between suggested champs. <br><br>
        My goal was simple: Imagine what a combo tool would look like if it was added to the game, like the one you can find in fighter versus game (especially with project L coming soon). <br>
        They've added a practice mode, but still no way to master your favorite champ combos, easily and quickly. So I've imagined a tool where you can select a combo from your favorite champ (I know, I used mine, but there's no real/difficult combo on Illaoi), have everything set up to practice it and even a combo sequence indicator. <br><br>
        For the combos tab in the client, you can see every combo and select it to go in the tool directly. You can access the combos from a champ, in the collection, â†’ champions then combos.
