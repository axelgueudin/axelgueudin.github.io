brief: Biotica, a hybrid board game to understand biodiversity in cities.
description: |
 Biotica is a work in progress project. It's a serious game + an hybrid game using augmented reality, about biodiversity in cities. We wanted to create a game to raise awareness among people about the interaction between the fauna & flora in cities. Players needs to cooperate to instaure a beautiful & useful nature in their cities. The board is modular, and players can choose the tiles they want so each game is different. They will learn a lot about the biodiversity while having fun during the game.
 
 Currently, we created a POC, with a board game, cards, pieces and an Unity app using Vuforia & Adobe XD for the experience. The application has the role of game master & opponent.
 
 We meet a lot of professionals, to gather the right informations about the flora. We made some users play test with an early version of our prototype, during a board game festival. The game will go through many changes and maybe, it won't be the same in the future.

<p>We made everything from paper and cardboard for fast prototyping. This allowed us to conduct some usability test. <br>
Globally, the game was enjoyable, the rules were simple and easy to understand but the users had some hard times to understand every rules because they weren’t clearly explained. We had to equilibrate the cards and tiles.<br>
This was, in reality, the 3rd prototype we made.</p>
